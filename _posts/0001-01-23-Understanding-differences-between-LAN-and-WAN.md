I have dealt with resolving LAN after LAN environment over the phone where customers cannot get home internet to their devices connected through a single switch or router. This environment usually includes communication with devices up to 10 meters. There are many different ways LANs can connect to our homes which I will get into later.

Our home network is usually a LAN.

WANs allow us to exchange data over much larger distances. Usually used for enterpises, they do this by using an interconnected cluster of LANs. If we need to help our staff connect to a remote on-premises server for employees working from home, WANs can do that. They are operated by a service provider that we can pay to access.

One WAN hardware setup can have more than one ISP under it's umbrella. 

WAN connectivity can occur via, cables, fiber optic, wireless, and Digital Subscriber Line.
