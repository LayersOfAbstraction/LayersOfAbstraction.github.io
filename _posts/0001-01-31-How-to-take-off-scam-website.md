## Introduction

Long ago my details were taken from a data breach and sold online to the highest bidder. This included my DOB, address, email and full name. Since then I have had random scammers phone me by my real name to help build trust. 

These type of scams can make phishing scams easier as your name and details are not something you give out to everyone. They can also feel more personal when you are been phished when you already know you're been scammed.

Just knowing that your identity is no longer your own and used maliciously, leads to a larger loss of innocence... and a larger desire to fight back!

Yes you can take out the hosted site and report the email domains they use. But you cannot afford to make things personal with the scammer. 

This blog was inspired by the Darknet Daries episode [Magecart](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/52/) with interviewee Yonathan Klijnsma and this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fIUiv9-UFk).   

## Step 1: Find out what we need to target

The domain name is like the central island of the scammer's site. 

We could say the website hosting provider builds a bridge to your island to allow people to visit it.

Informing the scammer's web host provider that the website is hosted for illegal purposes can result in either a refusal or silence as they will continue to make money. 

Others are more responsive. But even then it would be like destroying the bridge leading to the scammer's island. 

We could anomalously hack the site in various ways and set up a botnet to route a DDOS attack through insecure computers that unwitting people own. But if they were discovered by the scammer then they can be at risk of retaliation.

We could destroy all the infrastructure on the island through the hack. Even if we destroyed the site, it could have been backed up elsewhere. Their base of operations can always later be rebuilt and quite easily if they have a backup.

Then there is the domain name provider. We could imagine they own the island which the scammer rents. 

If we can convince the domain name provider that the island (domain name) is being used for illegal purposes, then it can be enough to evict the scammer from the island. 

Once the domain name is taken offline, the scammer will need to find a new provider or change their contact and company details to find a suitable domain name, and may have to even have to tailor the website to that domain name.

It's just more stress for them to recover from which makes it the best target. 

**Whatever you do though, do not taunt the scammer from your own email or phone number. These are criminals, if you make it personal, they will make it personal.**

You are best blocking them ASAP if they are in contact with you, now.

## Step 2: Gather intelligence about the target

We want to grab some meta data, find out who hosts the site and who owns the domain. I once saw a russian company hosting a scam website. 

Some of these Russian web hosting companies are a favorite among criminals who allow them to act with impunity, so if you are unsuccessful with taking down the domain you will want to contact these guys as a last resort. 

You can go to https://who.is/whois/ and enter the domain there.

Look at the Registrar Info:

You will notice the domain is owned by [publicdomainregistry.com](https://publicdomainregistry.com/process-for-handling-abuse/) who I have provided an abuse response link for. You can select the Domain Abuse section and then select the Phishing "Get Started" button if you were dealing with a phishing scam for example.

Sometimes the domain provider does not have a "report abuse" form. In that case if you go to [https://lookup.icann.org/en/lookup](https://lookup.icann.org/en/lookup) and type the domain, you should be able to see the Abuse contact email under the Registrar Information heading. 

Back to the who.is site if you check the Important Dates section that is a clear indicator that the scammer hasn't been in business long as it was used in 2024/8/23.

If you look at the Name Servers, notice most are within Russia. And if you search for the first ip address it will lead to a house in Russia, Pittsburgh. [https://www.iplocation.net/ip-lookup](https://www.iplocation.net/ip-lookup)

## Step 3: Inform antivirus sites of your discovery
