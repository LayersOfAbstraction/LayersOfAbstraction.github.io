## Introduction

Long ago my details were taken from a data breach and sold online to the highest bidder. This included my DOB, address, email and full name. Since then I have had random people phone me by my real name to help build trust. 

These type of scams can make phishing scams easier as your name and details are not something you give out to everyone. They can also feel more personal when you are been phished when you already know you're been scammed.

Just knowing that your identity is no longer your own and used maliciously, leads to a larger loss of innocence... and a larger desire to fight back!

Yes you can take out the hosted site and report the email domains they use. But you cannot afford to make things personal with the scammer. 

This blog was inspired by the Darknet Daries episode [Magecart](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/52/) with interviewee Yonathan Klijnsma and the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fIUiv9-UFk)   

## Step 1: Find out what we need to target

The domain name is like the central island of your site and the bridge leading to it. 

We could say the website hosting provider builds a bridge to your island to allow people to visit it.

Informing the scammer's web host provider that the website hosted for illegal purposes can result in either a refusal or silence as they will continue to make money. 

Others are more responsive. But even then it would be like destroying the bridge leading to their island. 

We could anomalously hack the site or set up a botnet to route a DDOS attack through insecure computers that unwitting people own. But if they were discovered by the scammer then they can be at risk of retaliation.

We could destory all the infastructure on the island. Even if we destoryed the site, it could have been backed up elsewhere. The house, their base of operations can always later be rebuilt and quite easily if they have a backup.

Then there is the domain name provider. We could imagine they own the island which the scammer rents. 

If we can convince the domain name provider that the island (domain name) is being used for illegal purposes, then it can be enough to evict the scammer from the island. 

Once the domain name is taken offline, the scammer will need to find a new provider or change their contact details to find a suitable domain name, and may have to even tailor the website to that domain name.

It's just more stress for them to recover from. Whatever you do, do not taunt the scammer from your own details.

These are criminals, if you make it personal, they will make it personal.    

## Step 2: Gather intelligence about the target

We want to grab some metta data. Find out who hosts the site and who owns the domain.
