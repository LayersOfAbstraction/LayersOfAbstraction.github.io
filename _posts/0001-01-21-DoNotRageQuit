I just want to be clear if you believe yourself to be at serious risk of injury then please disregard this blog do what you must to keep yourself safe. I'll admit I by no means consider myself an expert on the subject of mental health. 

But as someone who has been a disability support worker who has come across some dangerous and highly stressful behaviors I can with do doubt assure you need but twp things to help you survive. Resilience and understanding. I will tell you a bit about my background.


## Intro.

I did odd jobs but support work was really were I started to build... not so much a career, but a behavior. I built grit. Resilience. I had to run from some of my clients and get the retirement village manager to calm them down. Their behaviour was desclated overtime by upping their medication as per doctor's orders. No matter how well I tried to do my job it was just part of who they were and in their state I don't I could help behaving the same way. 

It was something I was prepared for though, knowing previous support workers had been assaulted. 

## Listen to the feedback! Don't take it personal.

I was stuck with the same client for a year. At times I just kept my distance stayed outside on my phone and some resident in the retirement village said to thier partner. "That's not care, that's bullshit."
"It's alright."
"Not he's out there! And his client was all the way in there."

Obviously that hurt but I needed to hear it because my client was at times a danger too himself but did not belong in an asylum because of his disability (which the government would unfortunately segregate everyone to a long time ago).

The way I survived was by doing coding projects in my spare time which energized me from such a boring job. Evenetually after a year and 8 months, work dried up. Nothing is stable in support work. Eventually I moved into customer service.

# Analyze the circumstances. Is quiting really the best.

I worked in a call centre and the turnover rate was so high that the company was bringing new hiring batches usually every fortnight. 

A colleague turned to me and said "They must not care about retaining thier staff if they're always bringing in new people."

I could see why everyone wanted to leave. 

* Heavy workload.
* Always having to do overtime.
* A vicious cycle of toxic team culture.
* No positive feedback everyone after improving company's docs and that was after been asked to do so. 

"It's shit isn't it." Someone said to me in the elevator. I lost my team leader plus one. You could complain about everything, evil corp, your upbringing, the distance to work, it been the only job could settle for.

But I had to ask myself, how does that help me? What does that change?

I didn't want to rage quit like everyone else not because I saw any light at the end of my current tunnel. Eventually after putting up a few dozen resumes, a recuriter gave me an opportunity at a national telecommunication company/ISP which had outsourced it's services to a foreign IT firm. 

I thought, an IT firm! This is my chance. Someone who had worked for the telecommunication provider a few months earlier advises that they left because "they micromanage you like nothing else." He wasn't wrong, the problem was though, they paid better. So I went to one of the most complained telco in the country. Of course I didn't get the IT job. But I got on very
