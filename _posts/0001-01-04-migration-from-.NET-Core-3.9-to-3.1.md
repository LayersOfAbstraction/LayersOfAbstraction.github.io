[_NOTE: This is a continuation of our previous post_]({% link _posts/0001-01-03-migration-from-.NET-Core-2.2-to-3.0.md  %}) that showed us how to convert our ASP.NET MVC Core 2.2 application to 3.0. As 3.0 is not supported any longer we must upgrade the framework to 3.1 which still has LTS.

I could tell you how to create an ASP.NET Core MVC 3.0 app from scratch but if you've already upgraded yours from 2.2 to 3.0 what's the point? So instead feel free to [download my 3.0 demo](https://github.com/LayersOfAbstraction/2.2_to_3.0_migration_project) (migrated from 2.2) and use that as a template.

Again just like the previous blog, we're going to use the KISS principle(Keep it simple stupid) or as I like to say (Keep it Stupid Simple) as in someone with language barriers or disability can use this. So we're just focusing on getting it up and running in 3.1. Nothing fancy.
