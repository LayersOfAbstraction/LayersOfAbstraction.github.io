Displaying all user profiles from Auth0 data in ASP.NET Core MVC

Here is some information so you know how Auth0 works without getting bogged down too much. I highly recommend you create a tenant for the region nearest to you if you want to test it. I used this Quickstart here to build a demo to understand the service better. I am using .NET Core 2.2 but this should still work fine. https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/aspnet-core

After that I tried to get a list of users including their name from my Auth0 data store but didn't know how to get the data. So I found out that you can use the Auth0 Management API here from this link.  https://community.auth0.com/t/get-users-and-all-assigned-roles/32854

It didn't make sense to me so I made this post and asked for help https://community.auth0.com/t/how-do-you-get-all-user-profiles-in-auth0-data-store-and-display-in-a-asp-net-core-mvc-view/46202.
