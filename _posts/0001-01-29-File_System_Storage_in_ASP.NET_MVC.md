# Introduction

In this tutorial you'll learn to create and see an index of files to download in your local filesystem, using ASP.NET MVC. 

You'll create clean, thin controllers with no model property references, by using service classes and interfaces that interact with your models.

I will show you this in a moment. I am hopping to make this into a 3 part series, the second one will be for updating and deleting from the View file actions and the last will show how to link file references to a database so their records can track which file in the file system links to what record.
