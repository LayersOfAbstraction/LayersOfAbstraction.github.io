## Introduction

In this tutorial you'll learn to create and see an index of files to download in your local filesystem, using ASP.NET 8 MVC and C#.  

âš  I won't be covering large file uploads. Only buffered (small files).

You'll create clean, thin controllers with no model property references, by using service classes and interfaces that interact with your models. This will make your code more reusable.

I will show you this in a moment. I am hopping to make this into a 3 part series, the second one will be for updating and deleting from the View file actions and the last will show how to link file references to a database so their records can track which file in the file system links to what record. 

We generally store files in a file system instead of a database like Access or MySQL, as documented on Microsoft Learn.

- It can handle larger uploads.
- Less expensive than using a cloud data storage service, especially if the data is on premises.
- Images and video files depending on their size are especially heavy on the database unless stored outside.

## Perquisites and setup

Do this in either a text editor, or an IDE that you know supports .NET 8 or if you hate locally installing dependencies, you can always find a Docker image for it. 

Visual Studio 2022 should have this already built in so I will quickly walk you through it:

1. Select `Create a new project`. 
2. Select from the available templates: `ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)` and hit next.
3. Name your project what you want. I named it as `File-Upload-Downloader`, and hit next.
4. In the Additional Information window, select .NET 8.0. 
5. (OPTIONAL). Highly recommend you tick `Enable Docker`. The reason being is because if you reinstall Windows then it makes your application more portable in the future so you don't have to install .NET 8. Set the Docker OS as `Linux` so you can use it outside of Windows if applicable.
6. Hit Create.

## What the structure looks like?

<img src="../images/0001-01-29/MyClassDiagram.jpg" class="image fit" alt="Picture showing disposable email"/>

We will create the models, then service and interfaces and after that we will just have the create the Controller and Views.

First we will break this into a series of tasks. My first one is upload files.

## Uploading files

First we will create a model and interface that will be the intermediary between our controller and service class to upload the files. 

### FileModel

Create a new folder in your project called `FileViewModels` and then under that create a model called `FileModel`.

```csharp
public class FileModel
{
    public IFormFile? File { get; set; }
    public string? FileName { get; set; }
    public string? FileExtension { get; set; }
    public long FileSize { get; set; }
    public bool UploadResult { get; set; }
}
```

This will be our view model representing a single file running in memory. We'll use the IFormFile primarily for uploading buffered files while the FileName property will be used for reading them.

## IBufferedFileService

If you are not aware of what an interface is, then there is no shame in checking [this out](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-c-sharp-part-1/). That aside this is what it would look like. We will be implementing our service through as a child of our interface and create  more methods later. For now you want to create this method which will be implemented in our service. 

```csharp
public interface IBufferedFileService
{
    Task<bool> UploadFile(IFormFile file);
}
```

## BufferedFileService

This is my faviroute class of the whole application. It helps abstract a lot of the business logic away from our Controller which won't have to know any of the model names.  

Create a Service folder and add this code. Notice we are implmenting it as a child of IBufferedFileService.

All our class methods will communicate with the interface via our constructor.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders;
using FileUploadDownloader.FileInterfaces;
using FileUploadDownloader.FileViewModels;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.Constraints;

namespace FileUploadDownloader.Services
{
    public class BufferedFileService : IBufferedFileService
    {        
        private readonly IWebHostEnvironment _webHostEnvironment;
    }

}
```
Our UploadFile method is quite a long one. Note how we are inputting the model properties in this method to avoid doing so in our Controller. 

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Method uploads file to the wwwroot/Uploads subfolder.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="file">Represents a file sent with the HttpRequest.</param>
/// <returns>Executes upload of file</returns>
/// <exception cref="Exception">File Copy Failed</exception>
public async Task<bool> UploadFile(IFormFile file)
{
    try
    {
        //Bind service to FileUploadModel.
        FileModel fileUploadModel = new FileModel
        {
            File = file,
            FileName = file.FileName,
            FileExtension = Path.GetExtension(file.FileName),
            FileSize = file.Length
        };
        //Validate current file extension against dictionary.
        var allowedExtensions = MimeTypes.GetMimeTypes();
        
            var maxFileSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB
            if (fileUploadModel.FileSize > maxFileSize)
            {
                return false;
            }

            // Save the file to the server.
            var fileName = Path.GetFileName(fileUploadModel.File.FileName);
            //Get the root path of your application via IWebHostEnvironment.
            var path = Path.Combine(_webHostEnvironment.WebRootPath, "Uploads", fileName);
            using (var stream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Create))
            {
                await fileUploadModel.File.CopyToAsync(stream);
            }

            return true;
    }
    catch (Exception ex) 
    {
        throw new Exception("File Copy Failed", ex);
    }
}
```

I'm going to explain most of the code except the try catch part. All you need to know is it stops user from seeing an error on screen.

```csharp
var allowedExtensions = MimeTypes.GetMimeTypes();
```

We are comparing the extension to our MimeTypes class dictionary which I haven't shown you yet. 

If the extensions matches any in the dictonary then we will allow the extension to be concatenated to the file path. Else an exception will be thrown.

```csharp
var maxFileSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB
if (fileUploadModel.FileSize > maxFileSize)
{
    return false;
}
```

We're buffering files so the file upload system does not get abused with very large files like employees, customers... hackers.

```csharp
// Save the file to the server.
var fileName = Path.GetFileName(fileUploadModel.File.FileName);
//Get the root path of your application via IWebHostEnvironment.
var path = Path.Combine(_webHostEnvironment.WebRootPath, "Uploads", fileName);
using (var stream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Create))
{
    await fileUploadModel.File.CopyToAsync(stream);
}

return true;
```

This code simply uploads the file to a relative filepath: `wwwroot/Uploads` in our current dirctory. In production you would normally save the files outside the application tree. Lastly the UploadFile method tells our controller to advise the user the files uploaded with the `return true` statement.

Our Get ContentType method is the next to analyse as it gets called in our UploadFile method. If you go to the GetContentType method, you will see how we analyse for valid extensions.


```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Checks if extension is in our MimeTypes dictionary and if not throws an error.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="path"></param>
/// <returns></returns>
/// <exception cref="Exception"></exception>
public string GetContentType(string path)
{
    var allowedExtensions = MimeTypes.GetMimeTypes();
    var ext = Path.GetExtension(path).ToLowerInvariant();
    if (allowedExtensions.ContainsKey(path))
    {
        return allowedExtensions[ext];
    }            
    
    else
    {
        throw new Exception("Extension invalid");
    }            
}
```

After that our MimeTypes dictionary is called to compare that it exists. All you really need to know about it's structure is that a MIME type consists of a type and subtype e.g image/png, application/pdf etc. Type is the general categroy like documents or audio while a subtype identifies the exact kind of data specified that the MIME type holds. [Mozillia Developer Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) has some more greta info on them. So if image/png is the type and subtype then the .png extension would be it's value. 

MimeTypes help the browser figure out how to process a URL since browsers don't use the actual file extension.

## MimeTypes
```csharp
public static class MimeTypes
{
    public static Dictionary<string, string> GetMimeTypes()
    {
        return new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            {".png", "image/png"},
            {".jpg", "image/jpeg"},
            {".jpeg", "image/jpeg"},
            {".gif", "image/gif"},
            {".pdf", "application/pdf"},
            {".doc", "application/msword"},
            {".docx", "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"},
            {".xls", "application/vnd.ms-excel"},
            {".xlsx", "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}
        };
    }
}
```

## BufferedFileController

To weave it all beautifully together, we access the Controller through our IBufferedFileService interface in the  Controller's constructor. The way we can upload the files here is through the `IFormFile` as shown in the Create action method. You will also notice Create does not need to know anything about our model properties which is delegated to our 
UploadFile method. 

You won't always be able to do this with a Object Relational Mapping tool but in this case our controller code is abstracted enough to have a reusable service that is not tightly coupled to the controller. 

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Net.Mime;
using Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders;

   public class BufferedFileController : Controller
   {
       readonly IBufferedFileService _bufferedFileUploadInterface;

       public BufferedFileController(IBufferedFileService bufferedFileUploadInterface)
       {
           _bufferedFileUploadInterface = bufferedFileUploadInterface;
       }

       // POST: StreamFileUploadController/Create
       [HttpPost]
       [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
       public async Task<ActionResult> Create(IFormFile file)
       {
           try
           {
               //If the file is valid in size and extension. 
               if (await _bufferedFileUploadInterface.UploadFile(file))
               {
                   ViewBag.Message = "File Upload Successful";
               }
               else
               {
                   ViewBag.Message = "File Upload Failed";
               }
           }
           catch (Exception ex)
           {
               ViewBag.Message = "File Upload Failed";
           }
           return View();
       }
   }
```
